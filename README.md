The goal of this project is to analyze mobility data made available by Apple.

Data obtained from the following URL:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

Currently uses dplyr to work with some of the tabular data. Eventually will also use ggplot2 to visualize data set.

### Change Log
* 2021-02-24: Added second script using dplyr to tally count of cities and counties in given state that have data for different transportation types.
  * Linked project repository to Github.
* 2021-02-22: A new version of the data file was downloaded. I also refactored the code to be more general and allow any state to be subset from the larger file.
  * Initialized a git repository in this project.
* 2021-02-06: Data file downloaded for analysis.
